# ARP-SDN-Dataset
In this repository, we have created the python codes to generate data in SDN environment.
The data is generated by taking the log of benign traffic and attack traffic.
The attack traffic comprised of ARP Poison and ARP flood attacks.
So, in total there are three claases (benign, ARP poison and ARP flood attack) traffic present in the dataset.
This dataset can be used with any Machine learning model for traffc classification.
