# ARP-SDN-Dataset
In this repository, we have created the python codes to generate data in SDN environment.
The data is generated by taking the log of benign traffic and attack traffic.
The attack traffic comprised of ARP Poison and ARP flood attacks.
So, in total there are three claases (benign, ARP poison and ARP flood attack) traffic present in the dataset.
This dataset can be used with any Machine learning model for traffc classification.
The dataset file arp_stats.csv is uploaded which is created by running main.py.
main.py is a python file which when runs create the ARP related features in Arp.csv and IP related features in IP.csv
Both the files are combined on the basis of logged Date Time.
The file arp_stats.csv is the dataset and can be trained on CNN-LSTM.py and achieved an accuracy score of 99.73% in attack detection.
